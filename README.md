# hello-world
This is a repository example created for Assignment 5 in CS 222
# My name is Emmaline Mercer! 
I draw and read in my free time, and I've recently started rereading one of my favorite book series. 
**This assignment is allowing me to learn more about GitHub. It is very helpful to helping me learn and grow in my knowledge.**
When I need to write a list, I make sure to complete the items and cross them out:
~~eat lunch~~
~~do assignment~~
~~write a list for Assignment 5~~
